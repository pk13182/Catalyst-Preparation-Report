# Catalyst Preparation for Methanol Steam Reforming (MSR)

This repository contains my project report on **Catalyst Preparation for Methanol Steam Reforming (MSR)**, guided by **Dr. Sweta, IIT (BHU), Varanasi** (Aug–Nov 2024).

## Report

## Overview
- Studied the **steam reforming reaction** for producing **99.9% pure hydrogen**.  
- Prepared **Cu–Fe/Al₂O₃ catalysts** using the **dry impregnation method**.  
- Gained **hands-on experience in catalyst loading** and reactor operations.
